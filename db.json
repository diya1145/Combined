It is built into products such as automatic language translators used in multilingual conferences, text-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, and knowledge extraction from text. This technology is used to scan data in the form of raw language such as handwriting, voice, and images into contextually relevant structures and relationships that can easily be integrated with other structured data for more efficient analysis in subsequent processes. Unstructured data are rarely used since they were originally meant only for use by humans. Hence, there is a need to utilize, understand, and unlock the vast wealth of valuable information hidden in them. Recent applications of NLP in the oil and gas industry include:\r\n\r\nExtracting structured data from free text embedded in drilling, well planning, PVT laboratory, safety, and mineral mine failure summary reports\r\nExtracting information from plant equipment reports as input to systems that automatically place orders for parts to fix or replace\r\nExtracting information from the details of production, which can be used to improve operational efficiency\r\nInteracting with machines to troubleshoot unexpected problems in a timely and accurate manner\r\nThe above-mentioned applications can make maintenance work safer and easier, in addition to significantly reducing asset downtime due to unforeseen circumstances.\r\n\r\nExpert Systems\r\n\r\nExpert systems are machines or software applications that provide explanation and advice to users through a set of rules provided by an expert. The rules are programmed into software to reproduce the knowledge for nonexperts to solve a range of actual problems. Examples of this are found in the fields of medicine, pharmacy, law, food science, and engineering, and maintenance. In the oil and gas industry, expert systems have been used from exploration through production, from research through operations, and from training through fault diagnosis.\r\n\r\nExamples of expert system applications in the oil and gas industry include:\r\n\r\nDipmeter interpretation to translate tadpoles into strata and formations\r\nElectrofacies determination\r\nReservoir characterization\r\nBlowout prevention\r\nDrilling fluid selection\r\nLead finder: to estimate probability of exploratory drilling success using neighboring borehole histories\r\nPipe sticking advisor: to provide guidelines on why drill strings get stuck and how to free them\r\nConfiguring wellheads assemblies for production wells\r\nDrilling planner to advise on choosing drilling bits and their speed of rotation, mud weight, and geosteering based on geological information\r\nDrilling monitoring of rate of penetration, drill cuttings transitions, and early warning for drilling incidences.\r\nRobotics\r\n\r\nIntelligent robots are mechanical structures in various shapes that are programmed to perform specific tasks based on human instructions. Depending on the environment of use (land, air, and sea), they are called drones and rovers. In the petroleum industry, they have been used in innovative and beneficial ways: in production; to connect different segments of drill pipes during drilling, in underwater welding to conduct underwater maintenance and repair tasks; in exploration to map outcrops for building digital models for geologists; and in field operations to inspect remote sites and challenging terrains that are potentially dangerous for humans to navigate.\r\n\r\nSome of the benefits derived from the use of robots in the oil and gas industry include improving safety, increasing productivity, automating repetitive tasks, and reducing operational costs by diminishing downtime.\r\n\r\nIntelligent Agents\r\n\r\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) is a subfield of AI that builds computational systems capable of making decisions and take actions autonomously. These systems are capable of maintaining information about their environment and making decisions based on their perception about the state of the environment, their past experiences, and their objectives. Agents can also interface with other agents to collaborate on common goals. They emulate human social behavior by sharing partial views of a problem, enabling collaboration, and cooperating with other agents to make appropriate and timely decisions to reach desired objectives. Agents have been implemented successfully, mostly in the manufacturing industries, and are proven to have potential benefits in the petroleum industry. Uses of MAS include:\r\n\r\nManaging supply chain\r\nAddressing various production- and maintenance-related tasks\r\nProcessing and managing the distributed nature of the oil and gas business\r\nVerifying, validating, and securing data streams in complex process pipelines\r\nGetting insights from data to increase operational efficiency\r\nScheduling maintenance\r\nPreventing theft and fraud\r\nStill, the application of MAS in the oil and gas industry is yet to gain the expected popularity. A smart integration of MAS with machine learning (ML) can bring many more benefits for the development of the industry."}}
